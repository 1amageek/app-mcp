# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Current AI systems can process text and images but cannot directly interact with graphical user interfaces. This creates a significant gap between AI capabilities and real-world computer usage, limiting AI assistants to text-based interactions only.

## Solution Vision
AppMCP bridges this gap by providing a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI systems to:
- **See** what's on screen through screenshots
- **Understand** UI structure via accessibility trees
- **Act** through mouse and keyboard automation

## User Experience Goals

### For AI/LLM Developers
- **Simple Integration**: Add AppMCP as a Swift package dependency
- **Standard Protocol**: Use familiar MCP resource/tool patterns
- **Reliable Operation**: Consistent behavior across macOS versions
- **Clear Documentation**: Easy to understand and implement

### For End Users (via AI Applications)
- **Natural Interaction**: AI can help with GUI tasks like a human would
- **Safe Operation**: Permission-gated access with clear boundaries
- **Responsive Control**: Low-latency screen capture and input
- **Transparent Behavior**: Clear logging of all AI actions

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Weather Forecast Automation (PoC Target)
**Scenario**: AI retrieves weather forecast for any location
- AI identifies Weather app using Bundle ID (`com.apple.weather`)
- Captures current app state via screenshot
- Locates search field using accessibility tree
- Types location name (e.g., "Tokyo, Japan") into search field
- Selects appropriate search result from dropdown
- Extracts weather information from displayed forecast
- Returns structured weather data to user

### 2. AI Assistant GUI Automation
**Scenario**: User asks AI to "help me organize my desktop"
- AI captures screenshot to see current state
- Reads accessibility tree to understand clickable elements
- Executes mouse/keyboard actions to organize files
- Provides feedback on completed actions

### 3. Application Testing Automation
**Scenario**: Developer wants AI to test their macOS app
- AI navigates through app interface systematically
- Captures screenshots at each step for verification
- Logs all interactions for test reporting
- Identifies UI inconsistencies or errors

### 4. Accessibility Enhancement
**Scenario**: User with motor disabilities needs GUI assistance
- AI interprets voice commands for GUI actions
- Executes precise mouse movements and clicks
- Provides visual feedback through screen capture
- Adapts to user's specific needs and preferences

## Product Principles

### 1. Security First
- All system access requires explicit user permission
- Clear boundaries on what AI can and cannot access
- Audit trail of all AI actions
- Fail-safe defaults (deny by default)

### 2. Standard Compliance
- Full MCP protocol adherence
- Consistent API patterns across resources/tools
- Interoperable with any MCP client
- Future-proof design for protocol evolution

### 3. Developer Experience
- Minimal setup and configuration
- Clear error messages and debugging info
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Excellent documentation and examples

### 4. Performance
- Low-latency screen capture (< 100ms)
- Efficient accessibility tree parsing
- Minimal system resource usage
- Responsive to AI requests

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Screenshot capture latency < 100ms
